 ATMega168 as a wireless 433MHz temperature sensor.

 
 How to use:
 ===========
 Flash to atmega168, connect 433 MHz TX to output PC2 - receive with rtl_433 (github.com/merbanan/rtl_433) or compatible WH2 weather station

 this is just a proof of concept, it can push valid packets from an ATMega168 to a receiver, you need to connect a temperature sensor

 do readings and modify the variables accordingly.



 Other crap
 ==========
 bitwise.c was used for testing bit shifting without having to flash the atmega eeprom every time
